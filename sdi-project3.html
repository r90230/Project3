<p>I decided to change up this week's theme, focusing more on a previous role playing story I used before.</p>
<p>The story takes place in the world of the Demon Possessors, a group of demons and the like who have sworn themselves to protecting the humans of the world from rebellious demons who would wreck havoc on the world.</p>
<p>While the story is not quite at straightforward as the dragon story was, it was easier to code for this one, using familiar names and variables to create the code. It was fun to do this project.</p>
